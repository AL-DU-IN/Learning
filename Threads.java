What are Threads??
Threads  are independent sequences of execution within the same program that share the same code and data address.Each thread has its own stack to make method calls and store local variables.
Advantages of Threads:
1:Handle concurrent operations.Server applications can handle multiple clients by granting each client its own thread.
2:Lengthy computations can be performed in the background without disturbing the user.
3:Threads make a code simpler.
4:Provide a high degree of control.
